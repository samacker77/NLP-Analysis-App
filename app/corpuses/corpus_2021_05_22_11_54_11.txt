The implosion of <SAMAR> financial markets means that as a nation we cannot continue to operate and expand a system that has all <SAMAR> wrong incentives.  Instead, with <SAMAR> right leadership in government we can fundamentally change <SAMAR> system to make it work better for all involved.  The health care system should meet <SAMAR> goals of slower growth in costs, much more equitable coverage, and continually improving quality.  _Total Cure_ describes how we can re-align economic incentives and markedly simplify our health care system to make it work <SAMAR> way it should.  It is written to be accessible to <SAMAR> informed lay public, yet contains <SAMAR> substance needed by policy makers.\\n\\nMost proposals to reform <SAMAR> U.S. health care system simply focus on getting more people insured.  _Total Cure_, however, observes that even for those with coverage, <SAMAR> system does not provide <SAMAR> care patients want, <SAMAR> quality <SAMAR>y deserve, or <SAMAR> financial protection <SAMAR>y need.  Physicians are hamstrung by paperwork and arbitrary fee and practice constraints, and costs are rising at unsustainable rates.  Providing more access to a failing system is not <SAMAR> solution\\xe2\\x80\\x94<SAMAR> system must be redesigned to work more effectively for everyone.  Adopting what may work in o<SAMAR>r nations, however, ignores American values, Constitution, <SAMAR> existing set of providers, organizations, and patterns of health care.\\n\\n_Total Cure_ outlines a specific proposal called _SecureChoice_ to overcome <SAMAR>se problems.  _SecureChoice_ mandates insurance for what requires insurance, using income-based subsidies for all o<SAMAR>r medical care.  Government focuses on that for which government is needed; well-structured market incentives foster flexibility and creativity.  _SecureChoice_ uses incentives and information ra<SAMAR>r than command-and-control.\\n\\n_SecureChoice_ establishes a single universal coverage pool, or UCP, insuring hospitalization and chronic illness\\xe2\\x80\\x94roughly two-thirds of medical care expenditures.  Financing can be through taxes or employer contributions.  Inpatient care is paid directly by <SAMAR> UCP, much as Medicare pays hospitals.  The UCP, however, pays care delivery teams, or CDTs, composed of physicians and hospitals voluntarily taking responsibility for <SAMAR> quality and costs of care during an episode.  _They_ will decide how to allocate funds amongst <SAMAR>mselves to achieve <SAMAR> best outcomes.  Unlike Medicare, which sets its payments on average costs and arbitrary budget constraints, <SAMAR> UCP bases its payments on <SAMAR> costs of CDTs achieving superior outcomes.  _SecureChoice_ is about value, not just cost containment.\\n\\nPatients freely choose <SAMAR>ir primary care provider without being locked into health plans.  The pool provides monthly payments to offset <SAMAR> costs of managing chronic illnesses.  Costs not paid by <SAMAR> UCP are largely associated with: (1) minor acute problems not needing true insurance\\xe2\\x80\\x94but which may receive income-based subsidies, and (2) higher costs reflecting provider-determined fees and practice styles.  Physicians can practice however <SAMAR>y choose, but may find <SAMAR>ir patients asking why premiums or fees for <SAMAR>ir services are worth <SAMAR> extra cost.\\n\\n\\n###The wide angle \\n\\nI am an economist who spent <SAMAR> last 35 years in a medical school training a wide range of post-doctoral fellows and undertaking applied research in an interdisciplinary setting.  My economics training inculcated a focus on <SAMAR> role of incentives and constraints.  Collaborations with sociologists demonstrated <SAMAR> need to consider organizations.  Political scientists highlighted <SAMAR> importance of governance issues and \\xe2\\x80\\x9crules of <SAMAR> game.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Anthropologists and ethicists illustrated how culture and values shape behavior.  Work with clinicians made real <SAMAR> uncertainties faced in day-to-day practice.  Interactions with administrators led to an understanding of how risk needs to be managed.  Quantitative tools demonstrated how large databases can be used to generate information and how crucial it is to focus on <SAMAR> quality of <SAMAR> data being recorded.  All <SAMAR>se lessons are reflected in <SAMAR> book.\\n\\nThe origins of this work can be traced to <SAMAR> early days of <SAMAR> HIV/AIDS epidemic in San Francisco.  Some health plans were trying to avoid enrolling young men who lived in <SAMAR> largely gay Castro District for fear <SAMAR>y might have an expensive disease.  I heard <SAMAR>se stories as a faculty representative on a committee overseeing <SAMAR> university\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health plans.  But this was of more than academic or fiduciary interest\\xe2\\x80\\x94our staff members were dying and were being denied coverage because plans were afraid of <SAMAR> economic risks.  The challenge I decided to address was how to change payment incentives so health plans would take care of very sick people and even become so proficient at such care that <SAMAR>y would gladly attract <SAMAR>se patients.  This led to years of work on risk adjustment techniques used both to assess quality and to adjust incentives.  I eventually came to <SAMAR> conclusion that prospective risk adjustment, <SAMAR> approach generally favored by policy makers, would never be good enough to solve this problem.  Instead, we need a mix of ongoing payments for <SAMAR> routine management of chronic disease (as HIV had now become) and separate bundled payments for <SAMAR> infrequent, but very expensive, hospitalizations.\\n\\nThe economics involved in this concept could be presented in a reasonable journal article.  That venue, however, would not allow me to address <SAMAR> concerns of real-world policy makers.  For <SAMAR>m and for o<SAMAR>rs interested in a real system for change, I needed to describe how funds would flow among entities, how to facilitate income-based subsidies to address equity concerns, how to make this work in a practice environment dominated by physicians in solo and small group practices, and how to handle information in a confidential but transparent fashion.  Describing an ideal world is (relatively) easy.  I felt an obligation, however, to describe how we could plausibly evolve to a much improved system, taking into account <SAMAR> existing laws, political structures, and interest groups.  A book, not an article, was necessary.\\n\\nMy policy proposal mixes universality and individualism.  _SecureChoice_ blends functions that require government with functions that are performed best by well-structured markets.  In <SAMAR> context of <SAMAR> current political landscape, _SecureChoice_ has important features that could be labeled as Red and o<SAMAR>rs best seen as Blue.  This may make it a target from both sides\\xe2\\x80\\x94or a reasonable compromise with <SAMAR> best of both worlds.\\n\\n\\n###A close-up\\n\\nTo be meaningful, a proposal to reform <SAMAR> health care system needs to be more than just visionary, it must address <SAMAR> complex issues of how <SAMAR> system will actually work.  _Total Cure_ provides such details, discussing how funds flow, converting data to useable information, and describing <SAMAR> ways in which <SAMAR> system can be reconfigured.  In essence, <SAMAR> book offers a blueprint both for those in <SAMAR> policy realm who can change <SAMAR> system and for those citizens who want to encourage <SAMAR>ir leaders to make such changes.\\n\\nThe logic and details in <SAMAR> book demonstrate to <SAMAR> reader that an entirely new way to pay for and organize health care is possible.  Blueprints, however, are rarely what attract a client to a new house. Chapter 8, <SAMAR>refore, offers what is analogous to <SAMAR> architect\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rendering of <SAMAR> structure to be created from such a blueprint.\\t Here I describe <SAMAR> experiences of a fictitious couple, Harvey and Louisa.  After <SAMAR>ir children have moved out and established families of <SAMAR>ir own, Harvey is offered an exciting new position on <SAMAR> o<SAMAR>r side of <SAMAR> country.  The couple needs to find new physicians, adapt to new employer-based plans, and compare this new system with <SAMAR> old one with which <SAMAR>y were familiar.  Their children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experiences illustrate how <SAMAR> _SecureChoice_ options work for those who prefer highly integrated HMOs as well as for o<SAMAR>rs, such as one son with recurrent depression, who are kept from full-time continuous employment.  Given <SAMAR>ir ages, it is not surprising Harvey and Louisa develop new and more complex medical problems and we see how <SAMAR> proposed health care system works for <SAMAR>m.  The chapter also provides a picture of how physicians are likely to react to <SAMAR> new freedoms and responsibilities of _SecureChoice_.  The Harvey and Louisa story illustrates <SAMAR> effects of <SAMAR> new system on a typical family, giving <SAMAR> implicit rationale for popular support for a major policy change.\\n\\n\\n###Lastly\\n\\nSome will ask, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif this is all so simple, why hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it already been done?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  The key is that <SAMAR> proposal doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try to solve all our problems with <SAMAR> limited set of tools we have been using in <SAMAR> past.  It adds new tools and seizes new opportunities that had not been available heretofore.  Insurance for hospitalization and chronic illness is critically important for everyone, hence _SecureChoice_ uses a universal pool for those aspects of care.  Insurance is not really needed, nor well-designed, for o<SAMAR>r types of care.  People may want help in smoothing out <SAMAR> costs of such care, but that is more like a credit card than insurance.  Income-based subsidies address <SAMAR> affordability problems for those people who need help in covering those costs.\\n\\nIntegrated health plans were created to coordinate and manage care, but <SAMAR>y are a solution for only a small fraction of <SAMAR> population and practitioners.  New health information systems and re-aligned incentives can allow many of those benefits without forcing independent physicians into large groups or restricting <SAMAR> choices of patients.  Employment-based insurance developed by historical accident in <SAMAR> years following World War II; subsequent policy changes inadvertently fragmented <SAMAR> insurance market and sapped its ability to foster innovation in practice.  The shift to defined contributions by employers, however, creates <SAMAR> opportunity to build on long-standing compensation structures in a new world in which families have multiple workers, sometimes with several jobs each.  The political window of opportunity is opening for changes that are less ideological and combine <SAMAR> collective action potential of government with <SAMAR> flexibility and innovation of well-designed markets.  Now is <SAMAR> time to give fundamental reform serious consideration.\\n\\n\\nBIO / CAPTION TO AUTHOR PHOTO:\\n\\nHarold S.
